# Tushar Bhardwaj

Software Engineer focused on backend systems, distributed architecture, and scalable infrastructure.

Ex-Software Engineer Intern @Microsoft, where I built production-grade Kubernetes controllers using shard-based coordination to improve CPU efficiency and system availability. 
I enjoy working close to the metal — databases, concurrency, and system design problems that break at scale.

I’ve solved 1100+ DSA problems with long-term consistency, authored and reviewed solutions on LeetCode, and actively mentor engineers on backend engineering and career growth.

Currently building backend-heavy platforms and deepening my expertise in system architecture and databases.
