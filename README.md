# Tushar Bhardwaj

Software Engineer focused on backend systems, distributed architecture, and scalable infrastructure.

Ex-Software Engineer Intern <a href="https://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>, where I built production-grade Kubernetes controllers using shard-based coordination to improve CPU efficiency and system availability.  
I enjoy working close to the metal — databases, concurrency, and system design problems that break at scale.

I’ve solved 1100+ DSA problems with long-term consistency, authored and reviewed solutions on <a href="https://leetcode.com">LeetCode</a>, and actively mentor engineers on backend engineering and career growth via <a href="https://topmate.io/tusharbhardwaj">Topmate</a>.

Currently building backend-heavy platforms and deepening my expertise in system architecture and databases.
